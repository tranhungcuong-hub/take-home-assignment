# Running code

This guide provides instructions on how to run the `main.py` Python script.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tranhungcuong-hub/take-home-assignment.git
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd take-home-assignment
    ```

## Running the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

2. Run the following command to execute the `main.py` script.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    If you are using Python 3, the command might be:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

3. The script will now be:
   ```bash
   Skipped row due to invalid age: {'Name': 'Cosetta Blanca', 'Age': ''}
    Average Age: 26.34
   ```
